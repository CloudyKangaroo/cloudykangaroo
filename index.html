<p>In September 2013, Jonathan Creasy (<a href="https://github.com/johann8384" class="user-mention">@johann8384</a>) set out to build an interface for our support and engineering teams that would bring a modern and functional interface to our new ticketing system, as well as bring integration points for our monitoring and configuration management systems. </p>

<p>In December, the initial release was deployed and Rich Chatterton (<a href="https://github.com/rmc3" class="user-mention">@rmc3</a>) began his involvement in the project to support improved interface design and added some back-end integration features. </p>

<p>In the coming months additional contributors are expected both from within Contegix and from within two other organizations that are currently working with this system. </p>
